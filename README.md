# BambuLabs_A1_Mods
### This is a collection of all the mods for the Bambu Labs A1 that I used

This collection includes all the Bambu Labs A1 print modifications I use in my setup. Since I couldn't find a better way to host them on Thangs, I decided to create a GitHub repository to organize all the files I’ve used. I’ll also reupload the files here to ensure they remain accessible if the original websites go offline. Additionally, I’ve included links to the original sources, along with any relevant information or helpful tips for printing these files. Please note: none of these designs are my own and I take no responsibility if these damage or break your printer. 

Almost all of these were printed in PLA

## Mods List

### Easily removable poop bucket for A1 and A1 Mini

```
> Tip: I used tree supports - came off easily with no issues. I have this printer inside a canvas chamber so I liked the fact it was small and compact. 

### EA1 Toolbox - Print-in-place
Source: 
```bash
https://makerworld.com/en/models/639173#profileId-860527
```
> Tip: I used tree supports - came off easily with no issues. probs didnt need it but meh. I printed the insert at 100% and the shell at 75% - again probably didnt need it but was nice to have a solid product imo.

### A1/A1 mini Cable elastic conduit
Source: 
```bash

```
> Tip: THIS IS A MUST PRINT! Also imo I would also add a cable chain, but at the time of writing this I havent done that yet. If I do, I will add it to this list.

### Ubiquiti (Unifi) G3 Instant Mount for A1 (mini)
Source: 
```bash
https://makerworld.com/en/models/837900#profileId-783498
```
> Tip: I use Unifi products, which is why I included this in the setup. I used a G4 Instant, and it worked well, but you can substitute any third-party camera you prefer. Personally, I just like Unifi products. I will also note the mount doesnt work but if you clip the tabs off it'tt work with the sticky pad that comes with it. But the other mod in this list was WAY better IMO

>> For the A1, this worked great for me. I heated the end that connects to the printer slightly to make it more pliable and pushed it in—it’s a pretty snug friction fit. I printed this with 100% infill for added durability. Be careful with the hooks, as they’re quite delicate. When removing supports, I opted not to use any, and it still turned out fine.

### Bambu Filament Swatch Box with Printable Inserts
Source: 
```bash

```
> Tip: My tolerances were slightly off on this print, but it still turned out pretty well. Overall, it’s a solid option for the included swatch kit. I have a preferred swatch kit design available in a repo (LINK HERE IF I MADE IT), but this one isn’t a bad alternative.

>> For the print, I used pan head Phillips M3x0.5 x30 screws. I got mine at Home Depot. They fit snugly, but I recommend using a drill to clear out the supports and make the holes more uniform. I didn’t use any caps on the ends, as the M3x0.5 x30 screws fit perfectly without any excess. If you want to add caps, you can use M3x0.5 x35 screws or. DO NOT OVER-TIGHTEN THESE SCREWS. Remember, it’s plastic, so they only need to be about 98% snug—just enough to hold everything securely without overtightening.

>> ### A1 Screen Mount for Unifi G4 Instant
Source:
```bash

```
> Tip: I like this mount better than the other one but wanted to include both of them. The creator also havve a mount for the G3 as well.
