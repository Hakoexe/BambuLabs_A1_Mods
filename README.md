# BambuLabs_A1_Mods
### This is a collection of all the mods for the Bambu Labs A1 that I used

This collection includes all the Bambu Labs A1 print modifications I use in my setup. Since I couldn't find a better way to host them on Thangs, I decided to create a GitHub repository to organize all the files I’ve used. I’ll also reupload the files here to ensure they remain accessible if the original websites go offline. Additionally, I’ve included links to the original sources, along with any relevant information or helpful tips for printing these files. Please note: none of these designs are my own and I take no responsibility if these damage or break your printer. 

Almost all of these were printed in PLA

> Tip: I used tree supports - came off easily with no issues. I have this printer inside a canvas chamber so I liked the fact it was small and compact.
